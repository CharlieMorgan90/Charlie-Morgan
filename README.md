# Charlie Morgan

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **data analytics enthusiast** and a **dual major in Data Science and Computer Science** at Temple University. I'm passionate about using my skills to solve meaningful problemsâ€”whether in sports, the environment, or any data-driven field.

## What I Do
- I use **data techniques**, such as machine learning, to answer interesting questions, solve problems, and provide meaningful insights.  
- I build **tools and visualizations** that transform raw data into actionable insights.  
- Iâ€™ve developed applications for various purposes, including **mobile ITSM apps**, **video game apps**, **speech apps** and other innovative solutions.

## Why Sports Analytics?
As a lifelong football fan (Go Birds! ðŸ¦…), Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by the numbers behind the game. Fantasy football first sparked my interest in data analysis, and that passion has since evolved into projects like **predicting NFL outcomes** and exploring the stats that drive success on the field.

## What You'll Find Here
This GitHub showcases projects that reflect my interests and skills:

- **Sports Analytics:** Work on predicting NFL game outcomes and analyzing key stats.  
- **Database Design:** Projects like my basketball database for tracking player and team performance.  
- **Automation & Optimization:** From AWS cost analysis to dynamic dashboards, I thrive on solving problems with Python and SQL.  
- **Machine Learning:** Exploring how data science can address real-world challenges (beyond sports, too!).

## Skills & Tools
- **Programming:** Python, SQL, Java  
- **Data Science:** Machine Learning, Data Visualization, Data Engineering, Statistics  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Datalore, SQLDeveloper, AWS, ServiceNow  

## Fun Stuff
Outside of data, Iâ€™m a huge fan of live music and sports. I've played almost every sport and am currently addicted to skateboarding and golf. I love exploring Philly, discovering cool venues, and finding amazing bands.
